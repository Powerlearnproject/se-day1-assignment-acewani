Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering focuses on systematic designs, testing and maintenance of software applications combining principles from computer science and engineering.
Software engineering focuses on improving the security,scalability, efficiency and sustainability of products. By incorporating the best practices with designs oriented with considerations of future trends software engineering greatky conntributes to the development and application of tech industies.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Requirement analysis: understanding and documenting the needs of the system being developed.
Implementation and tesing: creating a rough plan of action and testing out its application feasibility and making the necessary changes.
Routine maintenance and improvement.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement gathering and analysis: Understand and document what the system needs in order to meet the specified goal or standards.
System design: Create a plan of action with milestones that lead to the development of a complete and more holistic system.
Implementation: Translate the ideas into actual code that can be tested.
Testing: identify and fix bugs in the code.
Launch the system
Maintenance: Continuously review and update the system to keep up with the standards 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Watrfall method is linear and sequential while agile method is more flexible.
Waterfall method has fixed requirements while agile method has adaptable requirements.
Every phase requires documentation in the waterfall method while communication with stakeholders is enough for the agile metnhod.
A good scenario for waterfall method is in military projects and in agile method is startups 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: writing testing and maintaining the software code, carying out tasks like debugging and code reviews when necessary.
Quality assuarance engineer: ensures that the software meets quality standards before it is launched. They test and assess the quality metrics of the code and collaborate to gather and use user feedback to suggest improvements
Project manager: is in charge of the project and ensures proper planning, scheduling and coodination of the set scope of the project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide facilities for software development including text editing, debugging and running the code. Some examples are IntelliJ IDEA, VS code and jupyter notebooks
VCS is a system that helps maintain a record of previous versions of a software so that they can be recalled later.It can have features like collaboration, branchng and merging and backup and file recovery. They include git, annd Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Ensuring you meet a deadline while still designing a good system requires proper time management and discipline in following the plan.
Debugging can be a time consuming process which requires that you clearlyy understand the code and the functiond of the methods used.
Managing complex code bases especially through collaboration requires a lot of effort in establishing clear guidelines and communication channels.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing focuses on individual modules, integration focuses on the interaction of these modules and system focuses on the whole software program.
Unit testing ensures that each unit or function or block of code properly performs its task. 
Intergration ensures that the various modules interact as expected. 
System testing ensures that the program meets the specified standards
Acceptance testing being the final level validates the requirements and expectations against what was delivered and ensure user satisfaction.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt  engineering involves the design of clear and unambigous prompt refined to deliver the expected outcome from an AI model.Good prompts maximize the capability of AI improving productivity and reducing the amount of time wasted in delivering irrelevant data. It reduce the errors and enhances the user experience.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Prompt 1:Machine learning
Prompt 2: What is machine learning and how is it relevant in todays world.
